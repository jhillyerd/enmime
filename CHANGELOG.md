  dcomier.)


## [0.4.0] - 2018-11-21

### Added
- Override declared character set if another is detected with high confidence
  (thanks to nerdlich.)
- Handle unquoted specials in media type parameters (thanks to requaos.)
- Handle barren Content-Type headers (thanks to dcormier.)
- Better handle malformed media type parameters (thanks to dcormier.)

### Changed

  accompanied by parameters (e.g. a filename, thanks to requaos.)

## [0.3.0] - 2018-11-01

### Added
- CLI utils now output inlines and other parts in addition to attachments.
- Clone() method to Envelope and Part (thanks to nerdlich.)
- GetHeaderKeys() method to Envelope (thanks to allenluce.)
- GetHeaderValues() plus a suite of setters for Envelope (thanks to nerdlich.)

### Changed
- Use value instead of pointer receivers and return types on MailBuilder
  methods.  Cleaner API, but may break some users.
- `enmime.Error` now conforms to the Go error interface, its `String()` method
  is now deprecated.
- `NewPart()` constructor no longer takes a parent parameter.
- Part.Errors now holds pointers, matching Envelope.Errors.

### Fixed
- Content is now populated for binary-only mails root part (thank to ostcar.)

- Part no longer implements `io.Reader`, content is stored as a byte slice in
  `Part.Content` instead.


## [0.2.1] - 2018-10-20

### Added
- Go modules support for reproducible builds.


## [0.2.0] - 2018-02-24

### Changed
- Encoded filenames now have unicode accents stripped instead of escaped, making
  them more readable.
- Part.ContentID
  - is now properly encoded into the headers when using the builder.
  - is now populated from headers when decoding messages.
- Update go doc, add info about headers and errors.

### Fixed
- Part.Read() and Part.Utf8Reader, they are deprecated but should continue to
  function until 1.0.0.


## 0.1.0 - 2018-02-10

### Added
- Initial implementation of MIME encoding, using `enmime.MailBuilder`
